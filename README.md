# Personal website

This repository's only job is to give life to the page gabrielima.github.io, which redirects to my actual portfolio.

Some of my public projects are hosted here on github, with the url gabrielima.github.io/PROJECT_NAME. I didn't want to have the root page blank, which is the only reason why this repo exists.

My actual portfolio is hosted on Firebase Hosting and its code can be found here: https://github.com/gabrielima/gabrielima
