# Personal website

This repository's only job is to give life to the page gabrielima.github.io, which lists all my public github projects.

Some of my public projects are hosted here on github, with the url gabrielima.github.io/PROJECT_NAME. I didn't want to have the root page blank.

My oficial website containing my portfolio and blog is hosted on Firebase Hosting and its code can be found here: https://github.com/gabrielima/gabrielima
